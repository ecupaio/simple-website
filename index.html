  <h1>Just a simple website</h1>
  <p>As a web developer with over a decade experience, I've heard the phrase "It's just a simple website" quite a bit so I decided to make a simple website to demonstrate what that actually looks like.</p>
  <p>This website is the epitome of simplicity. It has no framework or CMS. This website is simply, HTML and a little bit of CSS.</p>
  <p>You won't be able to edit this website nor will you be able to add new pages, however this website is mobile responsive, scores a perfect 100 on Lighthouse, and meets all WCAG accessibility standards. </p>
  <p>From the domain purchase, design, copywriting, coding, analytics setup, and launch, it took me 2 hours to complete. At my contractor rate of $100 per hour, it cost $200 to create this site.</p>
  <p>Although this is both time and cost effective, it probably isn't what you had in mind for a simple website. The fact is websites are highly complex products that serve many different users: both visitors and editors, as well as enable you or your organization to achieve it's goals.</p>
  <p>The good news is that I am highly experienced in making websites that are easy maintain and built for optimal speed and user experience. Click the button below to see what I can do for you: </p>
